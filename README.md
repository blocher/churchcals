# Church Calendar API

This project provides a read‑only REST API for accessing liturgical calendar data and biographies. The API uses **Django Rest Framework** with **drf‑spectacular** to generate an OpenAPI&nbsp;3.1 specification and interactive documentation.

## Endpoints

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/biographies/` | List biographies |
| `/api/biographies/{id}/` | Retrieve a single biography |
| `/api/liturgical-year/{year}/{calendar}/` | Events for an entire liturgical year |
| `/api/day/{date}/` | Events on a particular day grouped by calendar |
| `/api/calendars/` | List available calendars |

Interactive documentation is available at `/docs/` when the server is running.

## OpenAI / ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude Integration

1. **Deploy the Django project** to a publicly accessible domain using HTTPS.
2. Make sure the following files are served:
   - `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` – plugin manifest
   - `/openapi.yaml` – OpenAPI specification generated by drf-spectacular
3. In ChatGPT select **“Plugins → Develop your own plugin”** and provide your domain. ChatGPT will read `ai-plugin.json` and load the endpoints.
4. Gemini and Claude can also ingest the same OpenAPI spec. Point them to `/openapi.yaml` when configuring tools or actions in those platforms.

Once installed, the assistants will be able to query the REST API directly.

## Running Locally

```bash
pip install -r site/requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/docs/](http://localhost:8000/docs/) to browse the API.
